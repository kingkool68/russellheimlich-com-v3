		<description><![CDATA[[...] Creating a triangle is a matter of setting the border-color on 3 of the 4 sides to transparent. You also want to set the width and height of the element to be 0 in order for all 4 corners to meet at a point.

		<description><![CDATA[This is one of the best tutorials I have seen on this subject.  I can finally wrap my brain around this.  I wanted to learn this technique so I could add ribbons to websites without using photoshop.  The examples with dotted and dashed lines are neat too, but I was viewing this article in google chrome and everything looked the same as the earlier regular triangle examples, until I switched to firefox and operah.  Looks like those techniques only work in those two browsers, but very cool none-the-less.]]></description>
