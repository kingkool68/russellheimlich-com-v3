		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on realizing your body is falling apart (coming together?)!!  Here are some ideas to supplement your exercise program:  1) get off the metro one stop sooner than you do now and walk farther.  2) walk to that stop at the end of the day.  3) use the stairs or walk up the escalator at your metro stops.  4) get a life (a physical life, that is) on the weekend.  5) go to no fat/lo fat versions of foods you eat (skim milk--hey, it&#039;s a habit), lite margarine, lo fat cheese, etc.  

Staying fit is a lot of work, but not as much work as being fat.]]></description>
