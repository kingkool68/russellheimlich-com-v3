		<description><![CDATA[I just found this post after searching for info on a stationary bike I purchased at a Salvation Army yesterday . My particular model isn&#039;t in any of the hundreds of photos posted  , naturally , but that&#039;s ok . One part , a strap , is torn on mine but I think I can improvise another if need be . I can still pedal it and that&#039;s the important part , and it doesn&#039;t hurt my knees , which are screwed up. So congratulations on the $7 price - mine was $20 but still a good deal because it&#039;s small and quiet .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Damn, I just threw out an Ab Lounge that Ian bought and literally never used (not even once!) in two years. I&#039;d have been happy to give it to someone, but I was too lazy to drive it to Good Will. The great thing about Baltimore is that you can just leave something out by the garbage and invariably, some random individual will pick it up. I wonder what sort of person would pick up an Ab Lounge from a pile of garbage? A very thrifty health enthusiast?]]></description>
