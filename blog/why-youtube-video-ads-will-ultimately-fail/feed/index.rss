		<description><![CDATA[Can you explain why video aggregators exist and how Google allows it?  I have had some of my videos copied (stolen) from youtube and placed on theuniversitytube.com and reposted as that thief&#039;s own video.  The site took it down as soon as I complained.  If I hadn&#039;t heard of the site, I wouldn&#039;t have known it was there.  One user at that site has posted over 100 videos and I presume all stolen since every one that I looked at was provided by users with different names on youtube. That site has ads on all of the videos. 

Video aggregators take you out of the youtube experience and put you in their site without having to host any videos.  Why would youtube allow it?  I don&#039;t see that they receive any benefit in it and basically youtube foots the bill for showing and hosting the video on another site.  I could understand if when you click the video on an aggregator&#039;s site that a new window opens up and you are back to youtube site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like what some of the network stations are doing with their online video, giving you 1 or 2 adds by a selected company during the commercial break. Of course this isn&#039;t feasible with youtube and user submitted, non-breaking videos. I have seen an ad like this on another site before youtube, although I forget where. It wasn&#039;t too bad, although at one point the ad that popped up, was over the subtitled/subtext, which is when I really &#039;noticed&#039; the ad.

Perhaps they should try to bypass this, and just randomly insert logos on people&#039;s clothing, or food products in the video.. lol

Or maybe contact each person, and force them to use logos in their videos. That should work. ;-)]]></description>
