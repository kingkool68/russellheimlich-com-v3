		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. I still haven&#039;t attempted to shoot any sports really. Other than running events, I&#039;ve been limited to boring shoots. I should go to some of these high school football games with the staff photogs at the newspaper, as I am freelance, and have a dummy press pass, I should be able to get with them no probs, get on the front line.

I might want to snag a 1.4x teleconverter too for this, as the 200mm doesn&#039;t always reach as far as one would like :D]]></description>
