		<description><![CDATA[When you check out you put the scan gun on the conveyor belt and the cashier scans a special barcode to signal your done shopping. Then all of your data in the scangun is transferred to the cash register system so you can pay and a receipt is printed. 

There&#039;s nothing really stopping you from putting extra groceries in your bag and not paying for them. It&#039;s also pretty easy to futz with the scale (ex. 10 apples = 0.1 lbs, sure why not?).

I&#039;ve never felt compelled to cheat my grocery store but their are certainly weaknesses in the system.]]></description>
