		<description><![CDATA[I almost made the same mistake when cooking up a pot of spaghetti for the group on our Finger Lakes paddling trip.  They had a jar of garlic sauce and I added the WHOLE thing to the spaghetti, but luckily, someone else saw me do it and we scraped the stuff out before I poisoned the entire group.

Seriously, cooking is FUN with a crowd.  I like camp cooking, because most people are clueless and really appreciate a few hot pancakes or a pot of spaghetti more outdoors than they would in your kitchen.  

Are you still having nosebleeds?  Maybe the garlic will help--keeps vampires away.]]></description>
