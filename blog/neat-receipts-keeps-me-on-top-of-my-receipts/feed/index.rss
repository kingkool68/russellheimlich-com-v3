		<description><![CDATA[I too realy like the software.

I am thought seeing issues converting a Doc. to receipts..  once converted you can&#039;t read the conversion to the receipt. Though... when first scanned as a doc one can read it fine..

Any thoughts... done all the cleaning steps required...

Thank you.. :)]]></description>

Where are the scans? I can only see then when I use the application.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also love my scanner.  Actually haven&#039;t thought of standing mine up and putting it to sleep with it&#039;s cover.  Mine sits on my desk all the time but since I don&#039;t really use it daily I guess I could store it.  Issue I&#039;m having is that I can&#039;t get it to back up now.  All that time backing up and then I got an error message.  Suggestions?  No response from N/R yet.  I&#039;ve downloaded the revised version.

Yes on the above.  My plan was to move the scanner from computer to computer but finally decided to just use one computer since then the backup would be in one place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I bought the Neat Receipts about 1 year ago.  My husband installed it on his computer and I need it on  mine.  He uses it for receipts, I want to use it for documenting the networking business cards that I collect. Do you know where I can get whatever I need to be able to make the scanner portable to use on both our computers?  I use VISTA.  We have had no luck finding it on our own.  Can I do an upgrade and just pay the company a bit more to use it on two computers?
Any help is appreciated.

		<description><![CDATA[A+B) Does the IRS accept digital receipts? 

Yes. According to ruling Rev. Proc. 97-22, the IRS allows one to prepare, record, transfer, index, store, preserve, retrieve, and reproduce books and records by either electronically imaging hard copy documents to an electronic storage media, or transferring computerized books and records to an electronic storage media that allows them to be viewed or reproduced without using the original program.

C) For scanning receipts, it&#039;s way less than 1 minute per receipt. It isn&#039;t automatic as you have to manually feed the receipts into the scanner and press a button. It&#039;s designed for people with few receipts they need to store.]]></description>
