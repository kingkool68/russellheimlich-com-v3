		<description><![CDATA[This discussion reminds me of the image thefts.
All you have to do is save the image from someones page and use it how ever you wish.
Dumb things like javascript disabling right click only has to be turned off temporarily.
People that don&#039;t like this get the response &quot;sue me&quot; and the cost outweighs the value, 
or the person just removes the copied content in his answer to the legal letter. 
Same is true for all the copyright notices all over pages and scripts.  The internet is an open place to utilize other peoples designs, and tho there are packers and the like, they too can be unpacked with scripts readily available. 
Don&#039;t get me wrong, I loath people stealing costly work and making money off it, but it has been done to most all of us.  
&quot;The Internet used to be a nice place.&quot; - JRBeaman 1999]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Phil. If you want to sell something in some other site to make some money, then why do u put it for free on your own site?

It simply doesn&#039;t make sense, or does it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am fogtower, the author of JSCalendar in ThemeForest.

&#062;which was based on an open source project from around 2006 according to comments in the CSS &#062;files.
You are wrong, in fact, text.css and setup.css are not parts of JSCalendar. They just use to create layout of demo page, make the page looks well, and JSCalendar don&#039;t use them.

&#062;know that this script is freely available from the author’s own site
After I selt JSCalendar in ThemeForest, the source in the my site is comperssed now.

By the way, I also am a professional developer, but I have to sell my product in ThemeForest, because I can&#039;t find better way to sell it. Maybe like jQuery, free use, but need donate.
Now I selt 9 copies in ThemeForest, got less than $30. :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think ThemeForest is aimed at professional developers as there&#039;s no point re-inventing the wheel if someone else has done it - that&#039;s just wasting your own time and your client&#039;s money.  However, the fact that this javascript was freely available on the authors website breaks the T&#038;C of ThemeForest, especially as it&#039;s based on open-source code.

But you&#039;re right, it is almost impossible to sell javascripts due to the nature of &#039;view source&#039;... but then again, there are people out there who are morally obliging and will be happy to stump up $8 for the work that someone else has put in.]]></description>
