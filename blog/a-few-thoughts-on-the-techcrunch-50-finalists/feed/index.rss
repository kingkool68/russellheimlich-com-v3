		<description><![CDATA[Nice roundup! Fitbit sounds very cool. I love stuff that has a hardware component.

Honestly, I see a place for OtherInbox too, but it&#039;s more for consumers who don&#039;t want to fiddle with settings.

And don&#039;t discount browser-based virtual worlds. You and I grew up in a largely 8-bit (OK, maybe 16-bit) virtual world... The next generation will be spoiled on Sony Home and Mii&#039;s... Once 3D becomes ubiquitous on mobile the &quot;games&quot; are over and the gesture-based &quot;signing&quot; to friends will take over.

That&#039;s the future, and I&#039;m outta here!]]></description>
