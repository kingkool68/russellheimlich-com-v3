		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had my fitibt for about three weeks.  First the application would not load on my computer.  Got that fixed.  Now the fitbit won&#039;t sync.  I think this was a complete waste of $100.00.  The fitbit is basically a glorified pedometer.  Its calorie burn is just an estimate and I haven&#039;t figured out yet how to adjust the steps to my stride length so the miles traveled is always off.  I tested on a high end treadmill and it consistently understates the mileage.  Don&#039;t waste your money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The FitBit will give you a good idea of how active you are throughout the day which is a good estimate for calories burned but you&#039;re right the FitBit does not monitor your heart rate. 

I like it to quantify my physical activity and generally like having all of this data at my disposal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great review! I am considering buying a fitbit because I&#039;m interested in knowing approximately how many calories I burn throughout the day. Unlike some other monitors, such as the BioTrainer, FitBit doesn&#039;t factor in heart rate or how much you sweat when estimating calories. Do you think these variables make much of a difference(because there is a huge price difference!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t really get a FitBit with the aim of changing my health. I got it because I like monitoring my physical activity and sleeping habits. It was really eye opening to see my sleep activity. My physical activity is predictable so monitoring that became dull. 

If you are trying to improve your weight/sleep schedule/ physical activity the FitBit is a great tool to help keep you honest. It&#039;s one thing to think you&#039;re being active and getting plenty of sleep, it&#039;s another to see it in cold numbers and graphs. Plus it&#039;s so easy and stays out of the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m seriously considering ordering one today (although they&#039;re a month behind on shipping)...  Just wondering if you saw any downsides to this device (other than it dying) that I should be aware of before I order?  Did it help you at all to stay fit or increase your awareness of your fitness level and eating habits?]]></description>
