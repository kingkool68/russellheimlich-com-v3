		<description><![CDATA[I have a 2008 Honda Fit.  Its a bit underpowered but I hear the 2009 has more power.   

Maintenance on the Fit is pretty cheap if you avoid the dealer.   When the maintenance light comes on take it in for an oil change (and sometimes a rotation).  This is about every 9 months for me but I suspect it will be over a year for you.  Now that I left AOL it will probably be a year before my next service.  

I like the seat configurations in the Fit.  I flip the 2 back seats up and put my bike in the 2nd row instead of putting it in the hatch (front wheel off to make this work).]]></description>
