		<description><![CDATA[Ah, so you did buy that combo package on ebay with the 2 lenses. How you liking your collection? I need to replace my mid-range lens soon. My 28-105 is hit or miss after dropping it, the lens sometimes pops out of alignment and half my shot ends up blurred, not good when you  are expecting good shots for print eh? 

I love my Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L, the IS is great... I&#039;m glad I spent the extra $300 on the IS version. Overall I don&#039;t feel robbed, or have any buyer&#039;s remorse after paying $1600 on a lens, unlike I assumed I would.

I need to replace my Canon 50mm f/1.8 mk II, it was a casualty to a big fall too with that 28-105. It works but grinds when it focuses, and I wonder how long it will be before it just stops. However, I think if I replace it, I will replace with the f/1.4. I&#039;d rather have a lens with a good body and also gain a little more DOF loss :D   Where as the 50mm is not a great walking around lens, it can really help you learn to set up shots well, its a very straight lens, no barrel distortion at all. But the big loss on it, is that on the rebel, and 10-40D series its an 80mm lens. I was thinking about getting a 35mm lens to regain the &#039;50mm&#039; I bought that lens for. But if I upgrade to an FF camera, no need.

I also just got a Tokina 12-24mm lens. Excellent lens. It is a lot sharper than the Tamron 19-35mm i had before, and it has a constant f/4 aperature which is a small plus. Super wide, and its not an EF-S type lens like the Canon 10-22mm. Although I&#039;d imagine the barrell distortion, chromatic aboration, and vignetting on a FF camera would make  you not want to use this lens. Of course you don&#039;t get that with the crop factor cameras.

But the Tokina lenses consistently rank over both Tamron and Sigma, which surprised me. I never heard much coming from Tokina - and when I was looking for an ultra wide lens I was comparing this one, the Canon 10-22mm, Sigma 10-20mm, and Sigma 12-24mm. Overall even with having more Chromatic aboration (easily fixable with raw files), the Tokina seemed to get better reviews.

Next I&#039;m looking at either the Canon 24-70mm or the Canon 17-40mm of course the 24-70 is ideal, as it would nicely fill the gap between my 12-24 and 70-200mm, but its also $1300 :D
Ive recently been bitten by the Lighting Bug, after finally buying a good flash, the Canon Speedlite 430ex, I&#039;ve been wanting to get some umbrellas, light stand or 2, I also bought a wireless flash trigger, and of course want more flashes :D I want to get about 3 or 4 in the near future and start doing some Real Estate photography.

So much to buy, so little money!]]></description>
