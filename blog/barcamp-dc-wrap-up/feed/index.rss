		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a great Firebug presentation--sorry you had to use a Windows laptop.  I agree with your sentiments on the event--the DC tech community really benefited from this and I think this is going to be the start of something wonderful.

Keep up the blogging and good work!]]></description>
