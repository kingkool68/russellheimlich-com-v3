		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;ll pardon my shameless self-promotion, you might also want to pick up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://remstate.com/projects/in-series/&quot; title=&quot;WordPress plugin for writing posts in a series&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In Series&lt;/a&gt; plugin. Clearly, you write posts that have a serial relation to one another -- this plugin will link them together so that readers can move back and forth between the posts without having to think to hard about it. It also takes the load off of you, so you don&#039;t have to worry about making sure all the back- and forward-links are set up properly -- just add the new post to the series, and go.

Give it a try, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll like it. :)]]></description>
