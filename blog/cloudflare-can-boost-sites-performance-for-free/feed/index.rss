		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, that was helpful :-)  Your answer referred to a guide with code that would point the Remote Address variable to the User&#039;s IP, but does not actually point to the guide.

One more Q you may know the answer to.  I have flash movie (swf) files that first check that they&#039;re being run from my domain before executing; otherwise they close automatically.  For instance, if a user downloaded and saved the swf file and tried to open it locally, it wouldn&#039;t work.  Any idea whether such files would be able to run once I use CloudFlare? My fear is that since CloudFlare will be caching the files offsite, they will not run.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
1. I don&#039;t think CloudFlare cache media from another domain. You can still continue to use embeds just like you always have been using them without any problem. 

2. CloudFlare makes it easy to get the IP address of the user server side. Just follow the code in this guide to make sure the Remote Address variable is the Users IP and not CloudFlare&#039;s. This should be pretty much the first thing in your PHP script. 

3. There shouldn&#039;t be any downtime. What is happening is you are saying &quot;Hey my server is over here (pointing to CloudFlare)&quot; and if your audiences DNS records haven&#039;t been updated then they will just go straight to your site. 

Have fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hello,

I&#039;m considering using CloudFlare to improve the performance of a flash/php/mysql/ajax site but have just a couple of questions. Hope you can help out:

1- Does CloudFlare natively handle embeds from other domains?  For instance on my site I embed content hosted on scribd.com

2- Does CloudFlare support IP authentication? I mean some of my scripts check a visitor&#039;s IP address to assess what to show him in browser.

3- When I change DNS settings in switching to CloudFlare, will my website be down? If so, for how long?

I&#039;m not a coder, so info as easy to follow as possible would be very helpful.

thank you,
-Patrick S]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a screencast of what it looks like on my end when trying to access the stats. It&#039;s like this most of the time I try to get to the dashboard. The video is a minute and a half and weighs in at 9megs.
