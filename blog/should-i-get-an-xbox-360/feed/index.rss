		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been wanting a game console... And Wondered where to go... PS3 or X360... I mean - the PS3 can potentially blow the 360 out of the water, but hasn&#039;t yet, mostly due to game developers and their lack of knowledge or time to devote towards the PS3.. But the X360 has a lot of problems, which it seems they are still struggling to overcome, for whatever reason. Then I look at the future of media.. Where will it go? Blu-ray or HD-DVD? I once was an avid Blu-Ray supporter due to its larger file size, but realistically - HD-DVD has done more for consumers as well as it seems the last few companies who were teetering on the edge have fallen towards HD-DVD.. I&#039;d really hate to get a PS3 and then Blu-ray loose out... 

So I wait, for more games, news, and features I guess..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude,

This game will ruin your life. It&#039;s amazing. I&#039;ve been playing the demo non stop for a few days. It&#039;s the most fun I&#039;ve had on a skating game EVER. It really feels like real skating, and the tricks are realistic.

It&#039;s a blast. Get an Xbox360.]]></description>
