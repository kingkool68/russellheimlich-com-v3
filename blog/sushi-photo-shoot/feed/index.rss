		<description><![CDATA[Great shots.. I know I said this somewhere, facebook probably. Maybe tweak the white balance a bit more towards 3000K (in that direction at least). Other than that, they are great with the DOF and make me want to run out and grab some spicy tuna, or an eel roll! I haven&#039;t done much with food shots.. I need to do more. I had to shoot a plate of food for a paper pub, but other than that, been meaning to get around to it.]]></description>
