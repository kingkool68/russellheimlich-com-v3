		<description><![CDATA[After 5 years, these are still my sole headphones. I wear them all day at work and on my commute home and they still sounds just as great. I&#039;ve had to replace the audio plug after the original one bent after dropping my media player. 

I also have to replace the ear pads every year and a half or so. I found it best to bite the bullet and get Sony&#039;s overpriced earpads. They fit the best and considering how much I use these hedphones the overpriced earpads still make owning these cans a great value for the high quality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had ~6 pairs of over-the-ear headphones and the Sony MDR-V6&#039;s are my favourite, especially for the price. Whilst I appreciate your review if you comment on the sound quality after just a week of use you should follow it up your thoughts after you&#039;ve run them in. As you said 200 hours would be a good milestone.
I&#039;ve had mine for over a year now and spend up to 30 hours a week in them, I love them. I can wear them for sometimes 8 hours (with small breaks). I kick myself when I forget to take them to work on Mondays or to bring them home on nights I would like to use them at home, I&#039;ll probably buy another pair &#038; some ear pads too and at $75 that&#039;s a simple choice, so much better than a $300 pair that I would not feel safe leaving at work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have these same Sony V6s but I&#039;m not agree with you, because I found them very uncomfortable after wearing them for more than 30 minutes, my ears sweat and get warm and red.
There sound quality is very good and I bought them especially because they produce really flat frequency response. but they are not as much  comfortable as you said.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tried replacing the pads on the old headphones but I don&#039;t really think that would solve my problem as the circumference is too small causing the headphones to press directly against my ear. The MDR-V6 fits comfortably around my ear and after a couple months of breaking them in, I barely notice they&#039;re there. I&#039;m so happy with these headphones!]]></description>
