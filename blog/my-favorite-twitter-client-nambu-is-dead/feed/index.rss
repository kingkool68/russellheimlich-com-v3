Yes, Nambu was a cool twitter app, but the two times I attempted to give (what I honestly thought were, and presented as) suggestions for feature requests and bug fixes I was met with arrogant dismissal from the developer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s ridiculous that tr.im was allowed to simply die. Unlike a Twitter client, a public URL shortener cannot be deleted without vast repercussions on the links that tie the Internet together. It should have been left running or sold, NEVER deleted. End of discussion.

For crying out loud, the domain name doesn&#039;t even expire until 2012-06-20. It&#039;ll be at least August 2012 before anyone could even try to set up a replacement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t have high hopes for Nambu after I saw how badly the same guy mismanaged tr.im. Still, he gave it a shot, which is more than I can say for myself or a lot of other projects. Maybe he should have sold both projects off.]]></description>
