		<description><![CDATA[I hate to admit it but i took this while driving on 95N in the far left lane .... yeah but i know how to get to my camera with out looking .  I was soo shocked to look over and see it was that guy who runs around DC in the question mark suit.  So i had to slow down in order to keep in line with him for just a few seconds. When Russell posted it ...and now that it is kind of blown-up i just noticed he was looking at me!!   WEIRD ... thanks for posting this Russell it makes me happy!!]]></description>
