<p>Thanks to Duncan Stephen&#8217;s <a href="http://stawebteam.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/creating-quick-and-easy-placeholder-images/">blog post about dummy images</a>, I was inspired to add a new feature.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>All of the customisation options have got us excited, but I can think of a few more features that would improve it even further.</em></p>
<p><em>The ability to set a width and an aspect ratio, for those times when you  know you need a 16:9 image but just can’t be bothered to get the  calculator out.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What a great idea! It took me an hour or two to thoroughly test the new feature to my satisfaction and push it live. I&#8217;ve also updated the documentation and source code for anyone who wants to take a look to see how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>You can use aspect ratios with the width like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/640x4:3">http://dummyimage.com/640&#215;4:3</a></p>
<p>or with the height</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/16:9x1080">http://dummyimage.com/16:9&#215;1080</a></p>
<p>I enjoy adding new features that make a designer/developers life a bit easier. If you have something that you would like to see dummyimage.com do, let me know!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2010 is wrapping up, I decided to take some time to chronicle the history of one of my biggest web development milestones of the year.</p>
<p>In December of 2006, I started my first real job out of college as a  frontend developer at <a href="http://www.usnews.com">USNews.com</a>. My first big project was to turn a new  site design from a collection of Photoshop documents into functioning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> code.  I had to slice up dummy images to put into the layouts. As the redesign  process wore on, sizes of elements changed ever so slightly meaning I  needed to make new images with each iteration. I had wished there was a way  to conjure up these placeholder images on the fly. I ended up tucking  that idea away in the back of mind.</p>
<p>For whatever reason I decided to purchase the domain <a href="http://dummyimage.com">dummyimage.com</a> on  the 20th of July, 2007. I can&#8217;t remember if I had some early prototype  version working by then but I had made up my mind that I was going to do  something with this idea. Like most tinkering web devs, I have a stable  of domains for other ideas sitting around until one day when I can get  around to them. Dummyimage.com was not like those other ideas.</p>
<p>Fast forward to August 11th, 2007, when I attended my <a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/barcamp-dc-wrap-up/">first Bar Camp  in Washington DC</a>. I had mentioned my dummy image idea to <a href="http://twitter.com/jgarber">Jason Garber</a> and  <a href="http://twitter.com/jcarbaugh">Jeremy Carbaugh</a> in passing. They said it was a cool idea and should be  pretty easy to do.</p>
<p>From then on, I was determined to figure out how to make my idea  work. Aside from toying around in <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> (which resulted in this blog  you&#8217;re reading now) I had zero experience with <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>.  I was quite comfortable with JavaScript however and found PHP easy to pickup.  On August 26th, 2007, I had <a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/dynamically-create-dummy-images-at-any-size/">launched my first version of dummyimage.com</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2449" title="Dummyimage.com Version 1" src="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dummyimage.com-v1.png" alt="" width="600" height="486" /></p>
<p>The first release was as simple as could be. The only thing you  could change were the dimensions of the images. Everything was a gray  background with the size of the image in centered black Arial text. I  released the source code via a no-frills zip archive for anyone to take  it and do what they wanted. I didn&#8217;t even bother with a design for the site itself thinking only a handful of people would even see it.</p>
<p>Around December of 2009 I began  toying with some new capabilities for dummyimage.com. The biggest  request I got was for the ability to change the colors of the background  and text. I didn&#8217;t really see the point so I sat around on the new  changes. Then on January 25th, 2010. My friend Charlie Park (whom I met  at the first DC Bar Camp in 2007) <a href="http://twitter.com/charliepark/status/8222003586">tweeted</a> out a link mentioning  dummyimage.com My site made its way through the developer community <a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/dummyimage-com-sees-a-surge-in-interest/"> like wildfire</a> thanks to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1077013">HackerNews</a>, and Twitter. Suddenly I felt the  need to get working on new features and a redesign for dummyimage.com  based on the feedback that was pouring in.</p>
<p>On March 10th, 2010,  (Chuck Norris&#8217; Birthday &amp; <a href="http://dayofawesomeness.com/">International Day of Awesomeness</a>) I launched<a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/dummyimage-com-gets-new-features/"> version 2 of dummyimage.com</a>.This added color options, the ability to  customize the text displayed on the image, and a simple form on the  homepage to make generating custom dummy images easier. I switched the  typeface from Arial to a completely free and open font called <a href="http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/">M+</a>. I also  released the source code under the liberal <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a> based on feedback  I had gotten.</p>
<p>I wanted the new dummyimage.com look to be a little rebellious. Most sites are centered align in relation to the browser. I deliberately made the dummyimage.com homepage align to the right. You can really notice this the larger your monitor&#8217;s resolution is. One person even sent me an e-mail providing a CSS tweak to make it center align. He thought I had made a mistake.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2450" title="Dummyimage.com Version 2" src="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dummyimage.com-v2.png" alt="" width="600" height="671" /></p>
<p>Since other people were doing other things with  the dummyimage idea like making plugins for text editors and different  platforms, I decided to curate those and <a href="http://dummyimage.com/#other-downloads">link to them from  dummyimage.com</a> I was happy to see my idea taking hold with the  community, even spreading to non-english areas of the web. I guess the  simplicity of my little project transcends language barriers.</p>
<p>Dummyimage.com gets about 10,000 unique visits to it&#8217;s one and only page. It&#8217;s single largest day of traffic was January 26th, 2010, with 15,766 unique visits. Of course most of the traffic comes from people embedding images into their pages. I get about 5.8 million requests (pageviews essentially) for a total of 11.4 gigabytes of bandwidth in a typical month. I have gigs and gigs of server logs to analyze if I really wanted specifics but I leave <a href="http://dummyimage.com/stats/">dummyimage.com&#8217;s server stats</a> open for anyone to take a look at.</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/stats/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2452" title="Dummyimage.com Traffic Stats for January to February 2010" src="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dummyimage.com-traffic-stats-jan-feb-2010.png" alt="" width="600" height="142" /></a></p>
<p>With the redesign I aimed to make a little extra change by placing 3 ad units to the left. They probably bring in a couple dollars a month via Amazon.com referrals. I don&#8217;t really pay attention to that stuff.</p>
<p>So all in all I&#8217;m  happy with where dummyimage.com has come and it makes for a great  milestone in 2010. Hopefully in 2011 I can manage to launch even bigger  projects I have in mind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since the <a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/dummyimage-com-sees-a-surge-in-interest/">surge of interest</a> in my pet project <a href="http://dummyimage.com">dummyimage.com</a> I&#8217;ve been meaning to add some new features. Today is the <a href="http://dayofawesomeness.com/">International Day of Awesomeness</a> (which coincides with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001569/bio">Chuck Norris&#8217; birthday</a>) and I couldn&#8217;t think of a better time to unveil <a href="http://dummyimage.com">DummyImage.com</a>&#8216;s new functionality to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/600x200/0099ff/ff"><img src="http://dummyimage.com/600x200/0099ff/ff" alt="a 600x200 Dummy Image" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a run down of the changes:</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/#color"><strong>Specify Custom Colors</strong></a></p>
<p>You can choose the background and foreground colors of the dummy image right in the url using a 6,3,2, or even 1 character hexcode. Don&#8217;t worry if you forget to do this as dummy image will default to gray and black.</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/#text"><strong>Add Your Own Text</strong></a></p>
<p>A lot of people wanted to be able to add their own text to a dummy image to better communicate what it is representing. Now using the &amp;text= parameter you can.</p>
<p><strong>A Better Typeface</strong></p>
<p>Arial be damned! Font geeks cringed at my basic choice of a font. Some seemed worried about my distribution of the most popular font on Earth. Now both camps can be happy as I&#8217;m now using the completely free and open <a href="http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/">M+ Font</a>. I also changed the X in the middle of the images to a multiplication sign × as pointed out by Erinah and Dave Cortright.</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/#standards"><strong>Standard Image Sizes</strong></a></p>
<p>Dummyimage.com is a useful prototyping tool and a lot of prototypes and wireframes have ad positions. Instead of memorizing dimensions you can now bring up <a href="http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/1421/1443/1452">ad sizes</a> by their industry-standard name like <a href="http://dummyimage.com/largerectangle">largerectangle</a>, <a href="http://dummyimage.com/skyscraper">skyscraper</a>, and <a href="http://dummyimage.com/fullbanner">fullbanner</a>. You can even customize the colors, text, and formats of theses sizes as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/#format"><strong>Pick Your Format</strong></a></p>
<p>Before you could add any image format extension to the url but my script would still generate a GIF image everytime. Now you can generate proper PNG, JPG, and GIF images and drag them into another app trouble free.</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/600x250/3/f00/&#038;text=Happy+Birthday+Chuck+Norris"><img src="http://dummyimage.com/600x100/3/f00/&#038;text=Happy+Birthday+Chuck+Norris" alt="Happy Birthday Chuck Norris"></a></p>
<p>And with these new features I figured it was time to give the site a proper, though still simple, design. Rather than bury how these features work in long, boring text I made a little tool that shows you everything you need to know with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>Not a fan of change? Don&#8217;t worry, you can still use Dummyimage.com to generate place holder images exactly the same way you have always been doing it.</p>
<p>So thank you to everyone who has e-mailed me, tweeted me, left a comment on a post somewhere or otherwise provided feedback on dummyimage.com. I&#8217;m glad so many people found it as useful as I think it is. Keep the ideas and <a href="http://dummyimage.com/#other-downloads">dummyimage variations</a> coming. I&#8217;m sure this thing could be better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way back in August of 2007 I built a simple PHP tool that generates place-holder images at different size by simply changing the URL. The idea came to me when I was working on a redesign for USNews.com. I hated opening up Photoshop, creating a new document,  filling the background layer, and exporting for web just to make a simple placeholder image. That is why I made <a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/dynamically-create-dummy-images-at-any-size/">dummyimage.com</a>.</p>
<p>I figured it would be useful to other people which is why I also released the complete source code, documented and including instructions for setting it up on your own server. But like most new things, few gave it any notice.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/charliepark/status/8222003586"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2105" title="The tweet that started it all" src="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/the-tweet-that-started-it-all.png" alt="" width="600" height="379" srcset="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/the-tweet-that-started-it-all-300x189.png 300w, http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/the-tweet-that-started-it-all.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>The other day my friend Charlie Park (founder of <a href="https://www.pearbudget.com/">Pear Budget</a>) found it when doing some in-browser wire-framing and <a href="http://twitter.com/charliepark/status/8222003586">sent out a tweet</a> to all of his followers. But he didn&#8217;t stop there. Charlie also posted it to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1077013">Hacker News</a>, a simple news aggregator aimed at geeks. It was obvious that my little tool was resonating with other developers with the tagline &#8220;Lorem ipsom for images.&#8221; In 24 hours, the Hacker News story got 161 votes with 77 comments, <a href="http://delicious.com/url/9884f62d71d7b1377096a40c137a0863">513 people bookmarked it</a> on del.icio.us, and <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/story/28917021/dynamic-dummy-image-generator-dummyimagecom" class="broken_link">337 tweets</a>.</p>
<p>What really struck me was how dummyimage.com was crossing the language barrier. I saw tweets mentioning in S<a href="http://twitter.com/alexandergarzon/statuses/8241230231">panish</a>, <span style="color: #551a8b;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Japanese</span></span>, <a href="http://twitter.com/paraboom/statuses/8273761981">Russian</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/apfelsina/statuses/8286247632">German</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/colorlab/statuses/8274427780" class="broken_link">Dutch</a>, even <a href="http://twitter.com/rATRIJS/statuses/8272595627">Latvian</a>. I&#8217;m glad my idea was simple enough that foreign speakers could easily pick it up without any translation help.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/natsucat/statuses/8262689731"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2101" title="dummyimage.com tweeted in Japanese" src="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dummyimage.com-tweeted-in-japanese.png" alt="" width="600" height="342" srcset="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dummyimage.com-tweeted-in-japanese-300x171.png 300w, http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dummyimage.com-tweeted-in-japanese.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>All of this sudden attention also produced <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1078801">helpful feedback</a> and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1078521">new feature ideas</a>. I started working on an update this past December for a few additions I wanted to see but this recent surge of interest has lit a fire under my butt to continue developing. As is the nature of opensource software, people don&#8217;t have to wait for me; they can adapt the code to their own needs. Here are some iterations that have already been made:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/xxx/fakeimage">Fakeimag</a>e (Ruby)</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/xxx/placeholder_image">Placeholder_image</a> (Ruby)</li>
<li><a href="http://iamwil.posterous.com/lorem-ipsum-for-images-in-french-maid">Lorem ipsom for Images</a> (JavaScript/jQuery)</li>
</ul>
<p>And somewhere down the line I would like to give it an attractive homepage. Hooray for side projects!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend I worked on a little micro project to help me during web development work. Have you ever needed a dummy image while laying out a site but opening a graphics app, entering the dimensions, saving it out, and uploading said image to your server seemed like too much work? Yea it was a bother for me to.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I created <a href="http://dummyimage.com">DummyImage.com</a> which let&#8217;s you spit out a filler image at any size you want. All you have to do is construct a URL like so <a href="http://dummyimage.com/300x240">http://dummyimage.com/300&#215;240</a>. Replace the numbers with whatever you want and my script will spit back a GIF image for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://dummyimage.com/300x240"><img src="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/300x240.gif" alt="300×240 Dummy Image from DummyImage.com" /></a></p>
<p>I have even <a href="http://dummyimage.com/dummyimage-source.zip">packaged up the source code</a> so you can download it, <a href="http://dummyimage.com/readme.txt">run it on your own server</a>, mash it to bits or whatever else you want. Comments, suggestions, improvements are always welcome and hopefully this thing won&#8217;t take down my server from all of the image generating on the back end.</p>
<p>Happy Dummy Imaging!</p>
