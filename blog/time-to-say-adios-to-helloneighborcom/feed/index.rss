		<description><![CDATA[Russell,
Thanks for taking the time to check out HolaNeighbor.  As a member of the team that built this product and company in a weekend, I am a little taken aback by your criticism of the site.  For starters, the idea is not half baked at best.  There is a complete business plan around the product, with financial projections, growth rate projections, market opportunities, the list goes on and on.  To say this is half baked is just wrong.  We did in a weekend what most startups take months to do.  Not only did we start a company and build a product (it is an alpha launch, there are more features being implemented as we speak), we also had a legal team, PR, design, user experience and marketing.  
The goal for the weekend was to start a company and build a product and hopefully launch something by the end of the weekend.  We actually accomplished that and a lot more.  For you to criticize something that you did not take part in nor do not really know anything about is simply in bad taste.  For the record, there is a core team that is continuing on with the product to get it to beta quality.  Once we reach that, I welcome you to come back and try the product and if you would like, we could arrange some time where we could sit down and discuss the plans in more detail.]]></description>
