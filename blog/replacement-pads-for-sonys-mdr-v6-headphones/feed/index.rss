		<description><![CDATA[Hi Russell! Nice post. I&#039;m impressed by how heavily you&#039;ve used the headphones, but is it still comfortable for 8-hour usage daily?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ones from Amazon are from Sony and are a complete replacement to the originals. They fit perfectly. It&#039;s so much better having proper headphone cushions again. Some people seem to really like these Beyerdynamic Velour replacement pads but I have not tried them. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MF7W2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=thebloofrushe-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0016MF7W2]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I ordered a pair of cushions off ebay they are about 1/2 inch too small they were about the same price you paid for your knock offs haha. Are the Amazon cushions as great as the originals? I love my mdrv6 cushions but they leave bits of matierial everywhere]]></description>
