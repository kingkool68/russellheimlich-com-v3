		<description><![CDATA[.... So i just wanted to correct myself because the person that wrote the article did say not to give up we would just have a slight statiscal disadvantage.... well realistically I think unless we are born into wealth and success, we all have some sort of a statistic disadvantage.  I think its just that surnames at the end of the alphabet are less common anyways so that&#039;s why it seems the ones at the beginning of alphabet have more success. Its not that they&#039;re successful because of their last name being at the beginning of alphabet, its that statiscally there are MORE surnames at the front of the alphabet. Just a thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about the people that founded and own Wal-mart? That would be the Waltons (and I&#039;m not talking about the tv show of the  large family that lives in the mountains). Then theres the Rockefellers who have always been wealthy and successful. Now off the top of my head the famous ones with last name starting with Z and although they are not the most successful, they are still successful.... Frank Zappa(singer), Steve Zahn (actor), Renee Zellweger (actress) and lets not forget probably the most successful Z surname ever....I&#039;d say Mark Zuckerberg has done alright for himself. You know who that is right? Let&#039;s just say the face behind facebook! At 17.5 BILLION and not even 30 years old yet, I&#039;d say that&#039;s success.  So although Bill Gates may be at the top of the list of wealth and success,there are several more I could list from O - Z, but I don&#039;t want to embarrass the person that wrote this article. ;) So don&#039;t give up, those of us with surnames at the end of the alphabet... (me for one being a Z surname!) They&#039;ll have to rewrite this article saying its those at the end of alphabet that are most successful.]]></description>
