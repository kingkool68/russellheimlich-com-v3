		<description><![CDATA[Yes I have.  They bought one to harvest Eurasian Water Chestnut in the Normanskill Reservoir in Upstate New York for a project I worked on when I was at Cornell.  Turns out that even if they stopped cropping and got rid of every animal in the watershed, it would take about 100 years to use up all the nutrient dumped into the bottom sediments of the reservoir, including the water chestnut itself, which recycled nutrients.  

On the canal in Gtown, the nutrient were supplied by legions of crappers on the shore for about 100 years during Washington&#039;s formative years.  Sins of the father...but not YOUR father.]]></description>
