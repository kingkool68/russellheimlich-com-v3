		<description><![CDATA[We have, evidently a minor infestation.  Less than a handful of droppings here and there.  We would empty drawers and would find a handful of droppings in one or two the next day.  

Our pest control guy said it was minor, and sprayed, but the spray affected me and we didn&#039;t want a repeat.  I ordered Combat Gel from Amazon.  Husband put some out.  The next day, near the Combat, was a dead roach.  That&#039;s 3 killed (2 were killed by husband) and 2 others that were found dead.  We will use the drawers to monitor--if there&#039;s droppings, they&#039;re still here.

Either way, husband will put out Combat Gel from now on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the info!  Have you used the gel with pets in the home?  We just got a new puppy last week and i&#039;m afraid she would eat the gel and get sick!  Any thoughts on how to apply the gel but keep small pets from licking it up?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haven&#039;t seen a roach since, but I recently spent the night at a friends house and the roach infestation is rediculous.  They have the baits all over the floor but that doesn&#039;t seem to be working.  I think I will buy them the gel for christmas (or sooner). I hope I don&#039;t bring any back home with me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have yet to try it but thank you for all the great comments.  I am so tired of keeping an eye out for anything that moves.  Ugh!  My question is, will this work on bedbugs?  I don&#039;t have them but they do exist in my building so I want to be proactive.  Either way, I am buying this tomorrow]]></description>
