		<description><![CDATA[another way it rewards you for swinging like a real swing: putting.  I just realized that if you look at the screen as if it were a real green ahead of you and putt the ball as hard as it looks like you should (instead of getting preoccupied with the shotmeter before hand and trying to replicate that force), it will work better than the old method on the previous golf.  In fact, if you practice putt distance based on the shotmeter in the same manner you did on the first golf, it will often not come close to the same force when you actually shoot the ball because the controls seem more concerned that you imagine you are hitting a real ball.  Like you know how when you&#039;re hitting a real golf ball you sort of tense up the moment before you&#039;re about to actually strike the ball?  Well if you don&#039;t do that in wii sports resort golf, you&#039;re either not going to get the shot off, of its going to go much shorter than you had planned.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[oh I forgot to say the reason why it really rewards you for swinging like a real golf swing is that the wii motion plus senses motion in all directions more instead of just back to front...so in the old golf you could just swing however you want and as long as the power was there, it would go straight...but now you have to twist your wrists correctly...and actually when you overswing, it seems to go further than previously]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The golf really rewards you for swinging and following through like a real golf swing, and it just occured to me that this also means you can hook and slice on purpose thanks to the wii motion plus.  Putting is a lot harder than in the original, mainly because it&#039;s hard to replicate your practice swing&#039;s distance once you&#039;re locked in to the swing that counts.  There are 9 new holes (the front 9) and the original 9 holes are the back 9, but thanks to the new physics and controls of wii motion plus, the old holes don&#039;t play exactly the same, and that&#039;s probably a good thing.  I have played two 18-hole games so far, the first with a score of +7 and the second with a score of -4.  (Damnit, it just occurred to me that in switching from my old phone to my new phone, I may have lost the screenshot of my best wii golf game...it was either -12 or -13)  Theoretically, I should be able to post at least a -21...but again, it will take an overcoming of the new controls to do so...and I&#039;m not sure that can happen ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If anyone has been to the arcade and played that game where you pilot a flying bike; purpose being to pop balloons and earn points + time (the name escapes me), you&#039;ll know it looks and feels similar to the Island Flyover game.

So yes, a game has been created based on the concept, and it&#039;s incredibly fun, but very difficult!]]></description>
