		<description><![CDATA[http://uktech.blognation.com/2007/07/16/tailgate-brings-transactions-within-the-banner/
and
http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/004902.html

Both mention the security risks.. Especially a cloned banner that appears to be a legitimate one. I&#039;m not much of an impulse buyer, so I&#039;ll probably stay away, anyways. Sorry for the double post.

Maybe this is just another lesson in researching your product, then researching for the best price, and not to trust a single ad/price/transaction. ;D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey this is nice, but unlike leaving an unsecured website and entering a secure site, is there any notice to the customer that they have a secure transaction? I mean I know you state the concerns - but there has to be a way to show securities without making ever page that it is on, a secure site page.

The idea is nice. Direct advertisement. I can see this having great effects with reviews and such, where the people are searching for product reviews before they buy. Now instead of doing 2 searches, they can search the review, then buy off the non-retail site via the banner ad. If implemented correctly I could see this being popular with impulse buyers.]]></description>
