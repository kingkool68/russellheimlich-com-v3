		<description><![CDATA[People don&#039;t realize the unique nature of the Music Genome Project. Most web &quot;radios&quot; are either DJ-driven (playlists) or genre/artist-derived. A very klunky system.

Pandora&#039;s magic sauce works so incredibly well it is almost scary. Real humans with music degrees classify songs. An algorithm does set up a playlist, but only based on those human recommendations. Better than Mahalo, I&#039;d say ;-)

What is truly scary is that the Copyright Board wields such power, and that the ramifications of the DMCA &quot;devil&#039;s bargain&quot; are still being felt. As one pundit put it, &quot;Pandora may have to be our sacrificial lamb.&quot; Paraphrasing, but you get the idea.

One last thing: I would put up with satellite radio-style ads every so often if it meant keeping Pandora alive. I don&#039;t fathom how musicians aren&#039;t more up in arms about all this (although I can see why the top-label artists don&#039;t give a damn as real music choice threatens their gravy train).]]></description>
