		<description><![CDATA[Comparing him to Sanjaya is an insult. Sanjaya is nice and modest. He never got cocky or claimed to be a great singer. Plus his performances were somewhat amusing rather than disturbing (as in the case of Luby).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[* &quot;Kenny, what are you doing?!?! Have you ever shown anyone your films? Do you have anyone you can show your film to who will give you some honest feedback? The whole Internet can be your stage by simply uploading it on to Youtube and shopping it around on some forums for a critique. Is there any connection to the Internet in Owego?&quot; *

I agree.  The site that this article http://www.triggerstreet.com/gyrobase/TriggerDigest?oid=oid%3A1149236 (that was frontpaged on Digg, which your comments there brought me to here) was set up for just that; to get honest feedback on your talent so you don&#039;t end up looking like and hack like this guy did on national television!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your comments over on my TV Squad post and to a certain extent here. He is a little Sanjaya like in nature, but the Blake comparison had more to do with his atypical style as compared to the rest of the competitors on the show and less with his talents (or lack thereof).

However, I did kind of like his film this week - particularly the location and the imagery. It wasn&#039;t so much a movie as a bunch of visuals stitched together and there was barely a hint of a plot, but I still found it interesting to look at.

On a sidenote, I&#039;m kind of fascinated by your kingcool68 aggregator. I&#039;m working on building a website and one of it&#039;s functions is to take the &quot;dugg&quot; stories of an individual and compare them to the &quot;dugg&quot; stories of another individual to identify direct matches between the two.  If kingcool68 could dump those into a database in a users profile it&#039;d do exactly what I need. Not sure why I&#039;m telling you that exactly. Just happened to make me think about it.

Why does your name sound so familiar?

Take care.
