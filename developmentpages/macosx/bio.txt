&info=I have always loved to create things that are useful and solve problems since I was a little kid.  The technical side of things always seemed to come easy for me and I quickly became interested in computers at an early age.

Today I have developed a love for anything digital and try to apply what I have learned over the years to real-world problems.  I hope I can help make the lives of others easier through various mediums of communication.
