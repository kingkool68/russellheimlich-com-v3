&info=<b>Dear Perspective Employer:</b> 

I am currently a student at the Art Institute of Philadelphia studying Digital Media Production.  My various courses and freelance projects have given me the experience neccesary to take on any challenge I may come across in the industry.

I enjoy all areas of Digital Media from aquistion, to post-production, and authoring.  My specialty is video editing but I have also branched off into DVD/CD-rom authoring and web design.  I hope to be able to apply my skills and working knowledge to a rewarding career at your company.

My resume is enclosed for your review and consideration. I will contact you during the coming weeks via email and telephone to discuss the possibility of setting up an interview. I will be available for full-time employment starting June 25, 2006. 

I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely yours,  

Russell Heimlich
