&info=<b>Dear Perspective Employer:</b>
I am currently a student at the Art Institute of Philadelphia studying Digital Media Production.  My various courses and freelance projects have given me the experience neccesary to take on any challenge I may come across in the industry.
I enjoy all areas of Digital Media from aquistion, to post-production, and authoring.  My specialty is video editing but I have also branched off into DVD/CD-rom authoring and web design.  I hope to be able to apply my skills and working knowledge to a rewarding career at your company.
My resume is enclosed for your review and consideration. I will contact you during the coming weeks via email and telephone to discuss the possibility of setting up an interview. I will be available for full-time employment starting June 25, 2006. 
I look forward to speaking with you soon.
Sincerely yours,
Russell Heimlich
